# HazeGL
a simple wrapper that i made so i can work with openGL easier

# Wrappers
1. Compute Shaders
1. Shaders (vertex and fragment shaders only so far)
1. Index buffers
1. Vertex buffers
1. Vertex arrays
1. Textures
1. Shader storage buffer 

# building
it uses [MakeMake](https://github.com/Emc2356/MakeMake)

just copy MakeMake.py into the root of the project and run `python MakeMake.py` and it will generate the makefiles
